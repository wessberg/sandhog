# `@wessberg/scaffold`

> A virtual Open Source project maintainer

## Description

This is a library that can generate and maintain relevant files for Open Source Projects such as READMEs, licenses, code of conducts and contributing files.
This README itself is generated by `@wessberg/scaffold`.

## Install

### NPM

```
$ npm install @wessberg/scaffold
```

### Yarn

```
$ yarn add @wessberg/scaffold
```

### Run once with NPX

```
$ npx @wessberg/scaffold
```

## Usage

`@wessberg/scaffold` will enhance your Open Source project based on the configuration provided in `package.json`.

### Generating a README

To generate a README, run:

```
scaffold readme
```

This will try to locate any existing `README.md` file inside your package directory or generate a new one if it is missing.
You can provide the `--reset` flag to the `readme` command to generate a completely new README.
Now, to get the most out of `@wessberg/scaffold`, you can provide further details inside your package.json by adding the `scaffold` property to it.
For example:

```json
{
	"name": "my-package-name",
	"version": "1.2.3",
	"description": "my awesome project!",
	"scaffold": {
		"patreonUserId": "",
		"logo": "",
		"contributorMeta": {
			"John Doe": {
				"imageUrl": "",
				"role": "Lead Developer",
				"twitterHandle": "",
				"isCocEnforcer": true
			}
		},
		"backers": [
			{
				"name": "",
				"url": "",
				"imageUrl": ""
			}
		]
	}
}
```

You can check out the `package.json` file of this package to see an example configuration.
If you want to blacklist some headers from being added to the README, you can pass the `--blacklist [...comma-separated header names]` option.
For example, you could provide `--blacklist maintainers,backers` to not add those two sections to the README.
In the configuration for the auto-generated README you are reading right now, the `--blacklist faq` option is provided.

### Generating a `LICENSE.md`

To generate a `LICENSE.md` file based on the license you've provided in the `package.json` file, run:

```
scaffold license
```

Many licenses require you to fill out some information such as the year, your name, as well as some details about your project.
`@wessberg/scaffold` will do its best to automate this by filling this information automatically!

### Generating a `CONTRIBUTING.md`

To generate a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file, run:

```
scaffold contributing
```

The file will be in a welcoming language and takes whatever metadata about existing contributors is available in the package's `package.json` and adds it to the file (for example, how to reach current contributors in Twitter).

### Generating a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`

To generate a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file, run:

```
scaffold coc
```

The `CODE_OF_CONDUCT` will be based on [Contributor Convenant, v1.4](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/).
